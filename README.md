# :vhs: **VideoService**

## **The library you needed to create your own Video Service**
**VideoService** is a python library focused on the BackEnd for Video Services, such as YouTube (Note that this library is not used in YouTube, it is just an example). <br>
**VideoService** uses a JSON DataBase to manage all the Videos on the server and its not dependant on external libraries to work (except for OpenCV and Lingua), all functionalities depend on bare Python libraries.

## :blue_heart: Main Features
- **Managing Video Files**
- **Managing Data Bases**
- **Search Engine**
    - Title Search
    - MultiFilter search
        - Length
        - Tags
        - Order
    - "Reputation system"

## :arrow_down: Install package

#### Make sure you running on Python 3.8 or above

### PIP
- #### **If you want user intended version, run:**`pip install VideoService`
- #### **If you want tester intended version, run:** `pip install VideoService[dev]`

### Cloning repository
1. **Clone this repository or download it**
2. **Put the VideoService folder on your project folder**
3. **You're good to go**

## :memo: Working On
I will add support for PlayLists/Series, on the next version of the library, but first we need the first deploy.<br>
A Languages API will also be released to make it easier to have language support, instead of having the dictionaries in your own server

## :clipboard: Documentation
Here is an extensive documentation of how VideoService library works and how to use it.
